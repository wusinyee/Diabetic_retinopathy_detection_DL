# Medical Image Classification using Deep Learning


## Overview
This project analyzes the effectiveness of deep learning models for medical image classification by comparing three architectures using a diabetic retinopathy dataset. Through detailed model comparison and performance analysis, I'll identify the most suitable architecture while considering technical limitations, ethical implications, and practical implementation challenges.
 
### Dataset Details:
- Source: [Kaggle/APTOS 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection)
- Size: ~3,500 retinal images
- Classes: 5 severity levels
- Format: High-resolution fundus photographs
