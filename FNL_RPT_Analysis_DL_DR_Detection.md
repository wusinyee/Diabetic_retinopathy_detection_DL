# 1. Main Objectives and Analysis Goals

This project aims to develop an automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection system using deep learning, addressing critical healthcare challenges in early DR diagnosis. We focus on creating a clinically viable solution that balances high accuracy with real-time performance, targeting a significant reduction in screening time while maintaining specialist-level accuracy.

Our deep learning approach leverages transfer learning and attention mechanisms to process fundus photographs across five severity levels of DR. The model aims to achieve >90% classification accuracy, process images in under 2 seconds, and provide interpretable results for clinical validation.

The project's success metrics are defined by three key objectives: technical performance (accuracy and speed), clinical reliability (specialist agreement and interpretability), and practical implementation (resource efficiency and integration capability).

# Display dashboard

The visualization shows:
1. Left: Comparison of target vs achieved metrics for key technical objectives
2. Right: Expected clinical impact across different areas, highlighting the potential improvements in early detection, cost reduction, time savings, and error reduction

This dashboard effectively communicates both our technical goals and their practical implications for healthcare delivery, providing stakeholders with a clear view of the project's scope and impact.
